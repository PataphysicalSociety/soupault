    (* XXX: We use this function to render widget names for debug purposes
       and to convert the topologically sorted list of actions
       to a list of widget names.

       This shouldn't be a problem because if indexing is disabled,
       MetadataExtraction will not be in the list at all;
       and if it's enabled, then the list will be split at that element.
       Thus it will never be added to any lists that we use to
       process widgets in a correct order.

       The fun fact is that
       "<metadata extraction>" is also a valid widget name,
       so there is a slight potential for confusion,
       if someone writes [widgets."<metadata extraction>"].

       But since TOML allows completely arbitrary keys,
       there is no way to produce a debug output in a way
       that unambiguously separates widget names from that virtual step.

(* Sorts the list of actions in a topological order.
   The list of actions may contain widgets
   and a special, unique, virtual step -- metadata extraction.

   One widget can be set to run only after another
   (the `after = ` option, so we need to sort them according
   to that option, at the very least. 

   Moreover, the user can tell soupault to extract page metadata
   only after processing certain widgets, using `index.extract_after_widgets`.

   That is to allow widgets to serve as metadata producers:
   a widget inserts something into the page (e.g., word count),
   then its output is added to the site index entry for that page.

   Metadata extraction certainly must run only
   after all widgets from the `index.extract_after_widgets` list
   are processed.

   However, we also need to ensure that metadata extraction
   runs as early as possible:
   immediately after all widgets from `index.extract_after_widgets`
   (and their own dependencies) are processed.

   Most widgets are expected to be consumers of the site index
   rather than producers, so placing metadata extraction
   later in the list of actions than it absolutely has to be
   would deprive those widgets of the opportunity to use the index.

   For this reason, we need to produce an extension
   of the widget dependency graph that includes
   metadata extraction as a new vertex
   and a bunch of new edges.

   One set of edges is explicit: those from `index.extract_after_widgets`.

   The other set is to express the idea
   that if a widget is not in `index.extract_after_widgets`
   and is not a dependency of anything that is,
   then it depends on the virtual `MetadataExtraction` action.

   The output either does not contain `MetadataExtraction`
   or it will be removed from the list
   by the partition_widgets function,
   so it will not cause widget lookup errors down the line.
