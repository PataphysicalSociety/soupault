(* Determines whether log coloring is appropriate in the environment where soupault is running.

   As of now, soupault officially supports two kinds of OSes: UNIX-like and Windows.

   All terminals in modern UNIX-like systems and Windows Terminal (built-in since Windows 11/2025)
   support ANSI color codes,
   so we enable color by default but give the user an option to disable it
   by using the NO_COLOR environment variable (see https://no-color.org).

   We also disable coloring if soupault is sending its output to a pipe rather than a terminal,
   as any well-behaved program should.

   If a portable way to test terminal color capabilities is ever developed,
   of course it would be nice to make this check more granular.

    https://example.com/foo/bar,

(* Option parsing and initialization.

   One difficulty is that many CLI options can override values from the config file.
   Soupault stores the config internally as a record instead of querying a TOML datastructure all the time,
   since it's faster and more convenient. The TOML datastructure is only used by built-in widgets and Lua code.

   However, it also gives the user a way to view the effective config with --show-effective-config —
   that is, view all values as they are in the real soupault state: defaults, values from the config,
   and CLI overrides.
   It also strives to make overrides available to Lua code so that there is no disparity:
   built-in functionality and Lua code must see the same values.

   That requires a way to inject overrides into the TOML config.

Visit https://soupault.app/reference-manual/ for documentation.

To build your website, you can simply run %s without any arguments
or specify --build explicitly if you insist.

You can specify a path to a custom config file using --config option
