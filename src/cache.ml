(* This module provides utilities for caching outputs
   that can be associated with unique string keys.

   As of soupault 4.5.0, the following things are cached:
     * outputs of external commands for preprocess_element widgets
     * outputs of page preprocessors.
*)

open Common

(* Cached objects are identified by hash sums.
   The choice of the hash function for this purpose is arbitrary:
   it must not be intentionally slow like scrypt,
   but otherwise even MD5 would be acceptable
   since accidental collisions are incredibly rare.

   I chose BLAKE2 because it was reportedly the fastest hash function as of 2022,
   and also because almost no one uses it â€” and I like to be contrarian,
   at least when it doesn't harm anyone else. ;)
